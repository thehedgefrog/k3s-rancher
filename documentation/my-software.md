# What software am I using?
### Operating System
I run Windows 10 on my workstation.  Heresy!

However, I run Ubuntu 20.04 in my WSL environment.

### Terminal
Windows Terminal v1.3, mainly on WSL2.  I'm using zsh via Oh My Zsh, themed with PowerLevel10k.

### Editor
VSCode everything, no questions.

### Browsers
Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi, Brave, even the new Edge...  I can't find one that meets all my needs.

### Mobile OS
Primarily Android 10, but I have an iPhone for work and another to run iOS 14 Beta.

### Security
I use BitWarden for password management and TOTP tokens.  Yubikey for everything that supports it.
